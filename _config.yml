  Well hello there... I am a generalist game developer.
  <br>
  Actually, I am a gameplay developer, but, when it comes to programming, I can make other things too (things like UI, animations and a teeny-tiny bit of multiplayer and AI programming). I can also make 2D and 3D art and integrate it into Unity (does that make me a junior technical artist? :O). I can also improvise sound effects and make them sound cool in Unity.
  <br>
