  Well hello there... I am a generalist game developer.
  <br>
  Actually, I am a gameplay developer, but, when it comes to programming, I can make other things too (things like UI, animations and a teeny-tiny bit of multiplayer and AI programming). I can also make 2D and 3D art and integrate it into Unity (does that make me a junior technical artist? :O). I can also improvise sound effects and make them sound cool in Unity.

#  I can also make 3D art (modelling, rigging, animation, texturing), I can also integrate 3D art into Unity (does that make me a junior technical artist? :O), 2D art (Illustration and animation with and without bones in Unity). I can also improvise sound effects, and make them sound cool by playing around with the AudioSource values from script.

#  Working for VReality I had the oportunity of learning a lot about Microsoft Kinect, Arduino, Oculus Quest and Unity, I also helped on the development of several Instagram filters using SparkAR.
